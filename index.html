        	<h2>Projects</h2>
        	<h3>3-D Graphics Engine</h3>
        	<p>In CSC 443 - Computer Graphics I created my own 3-D graphics engine from scratch for my final project.  It was written in Java and was able to display a rotating 3-D object's (such as a cube) wireframe and faces and I also applied Phong lighting to the model.</p>
        	<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
        	<p>In my free time, for practice, I coded the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe in Java.  It uses graphics and images I created for it to make the interface instead of using Java's provided elements such as JButtons</p>
        	<h3>Connect Four</h3>
        	<p>I also created Connect Four in Java, created similarily to my Tic-Tac-Toe game featured hand made graphics and interface elements.  The most difficult part of coding this game was coding the check if a player has won.</p>
